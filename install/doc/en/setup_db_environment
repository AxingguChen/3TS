# Database environment

We are using Unix ODBC to connect databases. The following are the general steps to set up the environment for successfully connecting to databases.


0. Setup database service (e.g., by docker)
1. Install the UnixODBC
2. Install the ODBC driver for specific databases
3. Configure unixODBC by /etc/odbc.ini (e.g., ip, port, username, password, database name) and /etc/odbcinst.ini (e.g., drivers)
4. Test isql connection 


The following are examples we set up databases (Oracle 12c, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oceanbase, CockroachDB, TiDB, MySQL) by dockers in Centos systems.
