current_result: The query result of the current SQL statement. Each row of table is separated by a space, and the fields in each row are separated by commas
expected_result: The expected result is the expected query result for each SQL that conforms to the serializability theory

The current result is consistent with the [(1) expected_result] of serial scheduling

Test Result: Avoid
Reason: Data anomaly did not occur and the data is consistent
